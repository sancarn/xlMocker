'Spec:
'This class has been designed to meet your performance testing and optimisation needs. stdPerformance uses the `Sentry Object` design pattern
'which allows for cleaner more maintainable code.
'Functions implemented on the class
'CONSTRUCTORS
'    [X] Create   - With Cache
'    [X] init       #PROTECTED
'    [X] Measure  - Create a performance measuring Sentry Object
'    [X] Optimise - Create a object which toggles runtime options for optimisation. Currently sets: `ScreenUpdating`, `EnableEvents` and `XLCalculation`.
'                   This is intended to be application agnostic.
'
'STATIC PROPERTIES
'    [X] Get MeasureKeys - Get an array of procs/blocks which have been measured
'    [x] Get Measurement(sProcOrBlock) - Get the average time it took to execute a block.
'    [ ] Get MeasuresStr
'    [ ] Get MeasuresHtml
'
'STATIC methods
'    [x] MeasuresClear() - Clear the performance stack.
'
'OUT-OF-SCOPE
'    * Anything performance related which is specific, should realistically be honed to a specific class for that thing.
'
'EXAMPLES
'# 1 - Usage of Optimser
'
'   'Disable numerous options for performance
'   Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4105
'   With stdPerformance.Optimiser()
'     Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4135
'   End With
'   Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4105
'
'   'Disable everything BUT Calculation
'   Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4105
'   With stdPerformance.Optimiser(Calculation:=xlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic)
'     Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4105
'   End With
'   Debug.Print Application.ScreenUpdating, Application.EnableEvents, Application.Calculation         'false,false,-4105
'
'# 2 - measuring performance:
'
'   With stdPerformance.measure("#1 Select then set")
'     For i = 1 to C_MAX
'       cells(1,1).select
'       selection.value = "hello"
'     Next
'   End With
'
'   With stdPerformance.measure("#2 Set directly")
'     For i = 1 to C_MAX
'       cells(1,1).value = "hello"
'     next
'   End With
